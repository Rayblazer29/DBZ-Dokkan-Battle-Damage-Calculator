          <p>
            - Stat Presets for infamous hard-hitters (e.g Gamma 1 & 2)<br>
            - MUCH cleaner and understanable UI (with pop-up ? icons that explain it in simpler terms +- a short clip showing what to do) <br>
            - A video tutorial maybe?<br>
            - CRITS <br>
            - Add other characters + 1% chance of spawning LR Golden Freddy <br>
            - Slot 2 and 3 units. I wanna make a toggle that lets your character stack defense during attacking (if any) <br>
            - An addition to above, if the character lowers enemy attack upon SuperAttack/Multiple Supers. <br>
            - ANOTHER addition to above, Unit Supers, Ultra Supers, and Supers do different things. Tricky. <br>
            - Green-Yellow-Red-Deep Red Skull emoji indicators correlating to the damage

        <h3>18/1/26 - UI Cleanup</h3>
        <p>
          - Added subtle glow to input boxes. <br>
          - Changed 'DR vs Normals' and 'DR vs Super Attacks' to be listed under a new dropdown section 'Additional DR'. <br>
          - Gave 'Guard' button a new look, as well as added a crit button, but ineffective as of currently. <br>
          - Added Attack Buff % for enemy character. <br>
          - Reorganised calculator page. <br> <br>

        </p>
        <h3>17/1/26 - Pain</h3>
        <p>
          - Tried implementing crit for 4 hours, researching and testing formulae for crit, failed.<br> 
          - Fixed Guard, used to be underpowered.<br> <br>
        <h3>16/1/26 - Picking up where I left off</h3>
        <p>
          - Readjusted the background a little bit. <br>
          - Added Devlog. <br>
          - Added reference to the evidence I used to make the equaation I use for the calculator. <br>
          - Implemented the 2 new pages with NavBoard and their own respective HTML files. <br>
          - Added plans.<br>
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>15/1/26 - Birth</h3>
        <p>
          The beginning of the journey to make a clean-looking, user-friendly and easily understandable version of a damage calculator in DBZ: Dokkan Battle. Today, took a few hours to research and nail the damage formula, use temporory (admittedly) ugly looking buttons as a placeholder just to ensure the equation logic is working as intended. Added a nice background too where I learnt to reposition, scale and layer pngs on a website. For a first day, I am very satisfied.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          TL:DR:
          <br><br>
          - Researched formula <br>
          - Implemented formula <br>
          - Debugged formula <br>
          - Added background
